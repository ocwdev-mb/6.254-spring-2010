As part of the requirements of the course, you need to complete a project on a topic of your choice, related to the class material. We encourage you to work in groups of 2-3 people.

Project Topics
--------------

There is a lot of flexibility on the choice of the topic, as long as it overlaps with the issues and methods covered in this class. We will be happy to discuss candidate topics with you and provide pointers to the literature. A reading list is provided. ({{% resource_link 0a8fffe6-cda4-c40b-0377-859e41bf9e79 "PDF" %}})

Possible project types include but are not limited to:

*   You can read and report on 2-3 papers on a theoretical or application area related to the subject. This involves a deep understanding of and critically evaluating the papers. You can include not just a synthesis of the material you read, but also (in part) your own research or thoughts on the subject.
*   You can do theoretical analysis of a mechanism/type of game, which we have not covered in class and which has not been fully explored in the literature.
*   You can do an experimental study via implementation and simulation of a game/mechanism.

Do not worry about obtaining original research results. However, try to go a little beyond just reading and summarizing the results of a published paper by thinking critically of its presentation or its potential extensions, its connection to related papers, etc.

Project Proposal
----------------

Please submit a brief project proposal by Lec #17. The proposal should include: potential topic, project group, and a brief description of the work plan. Please feel free to consult with us before this date about the project topic.

Project Presentations and Report
--------------------------------

We will have oral presentations of all projects during the last week of class. The presentations will most likely be during the regular class time. You are expected to submit a report on your project.

The project report should be written with at least 12pt font, single space, and single column. It should be at most 5 pages in length for a single person project, at most 8 pages for two people and at most 10 pages for three people, not including figures. The length restriction is intended to help you focus on delivering a crisp message. On the other hand, you can include an appendix with additional material (e.g., long technical arguments, if you think these are necessary).
